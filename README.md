## My process 💻✒

### Built with 🧱🛠

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned 📚

I'm improving my hability to create Landing pages using Grid and flexbox.

### Continued development 🚀

My current goal is to finish all the FrontEnd Mentor challenges, to train and learn in the process. After finishing all HTML and CSS challenges, I will start JavaScript lessons.

### Useful resources 🎒

- [Como fazer um footer RESPONSIVO usando HTML e CSS (com FLEXBOX e GRID)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUFzgCwJZkk) - This helped me to create a better Responsible Footer.

- [Stefan Bojkovski - Solution](https://xstephx.github.io/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout-challenge/) - After I finished the first time, I took a look at Stefan's solution and saw that I could still improve, so I "tweaked" my code. (If you wanna see what I've done different, search my commits and you will see my page spacing going crazy 😅).
